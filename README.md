"GPT2Snapshot: An interactive tool leveraging GPT-2 to generate succinct summaries from user prompts. Streamline your reading, get the essence in a snapshot!"
GPT-2 Interactive Summarizer
Description:

This project utilizes the GPT-2 model from the Hugging Face's Transformers library to provide interactive text summarization capabilities. Users input a task or prompt, and the model responds with a concise summary. The code ensures all dependencies are installed, handles model downloading and loading, and offers intelligent text chunking for longer inputs.

Features:

Automatic installation of required packages.
Dynamic checking and downloading of the GPT-2 model.
Intelligent text chunking for handling longer user inputs.
Simple and interactive CLI for easy user engagement.
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Run the main script.
Input your text or prompt when prompted.
Receive a concise summary from the GPT-2 model.
Note: This project is designed for local usage and leverages the GPT-2 model due to its availability for direct download. For advanced capabilities, consider integrating with the OpenAI API to access more powerful models like GPT-3.
